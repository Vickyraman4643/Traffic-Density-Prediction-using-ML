## Introduction

Accurate traffic density prediction is vital for smart city planning and efficient transportation management. This project develops machine learning models that analyze historical traffic and environmental data to predict traffic density at different locations and times. These predictions help urban planners make data-driven decisions to reduce congestion and improve city mobility.

## Dataset

- Contains historical traffic density data, weather conditions, time, and urban area information.
- Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical features.
- Example data sources: city traffic departments, open data initiatives, simulated datasets.

## Methodology

- Explored and visualized data trends and seasonality in traffic patterns.
- Engineered features like hour of day, day of week, weather impact, and special events.
- Implemented and compared multiple machine learning models such as:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Support Vector Regression
- Used cross-validation and grid search to optimize model parameters.

## Model Training

- Models were evaluated using metrics including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² Score.
- The best-performing model achieved high predictive accuracy on validation and test sets.

## Results

- **Model Performance:** Achieved [insert accuracy/metrics here].
- **Insights:** Identified key factors influencing traffic density (e.g., rush hours, weather, events).
- **Impact:** Model predictions provide actionable insights for traffic control and city planners.
